	<title>Free/Libr&#233; and Open Source Software (FLOSS)</title>
	
	<para>
	
	<acronym>FLOSS</acronym> is based on the concept of a community, which itself is
	based on the concept of sharing, and particularly the sharing of knowledge.
	FLOSS are free for usage, modification and redistribution.

	If you have already read this book, then you are familiar with FLOSS as well since
	you have been using <emphasis role="bold">Python</emphasis> all along!

	<para>
	
	If you want to know more about FLOSS, you can explore the following list. I have
	listed some big FLOSS as well as those FLOSS which are cross-platform (i.e. work
	on Linux, Windows, etc.) so that you can try using these software without the
	need to switch to Linux immediately <emphasis>although you eventually will
	;-)</emphasis>

				<title>Linux</title>
				<para>
				
				This is a FLOSS operating system that the whole world is slowly
				embracing! It was started by Linus Torvalds as a student. Now, it
				is giving competition to Microsoft Windows. The latest 2.6 kernel
				is a major breakthrough w.r.t. speed, stability and scalability.

				<title>Knoppix</title>
				<para>
				
				This is a distribution of Linux which runs off just the CD!
				There is no installation required -  you can just reboot your
				computer, pop the CD in the drive and start using a full-featured
				Linux distribution!  You can use all the various FLOSS that comes
				with a standard Linux distribution such as running Python programs,
				compiling C programs, watching movies, etc. Then, reboot your
				computer again, remove the CD and use your existing OS, as if
				nothing happened at all.

				ECMA standards of the CLI and C# which Microsoft, Intel and HP have
				submitted for standardization and they have now become open standards.
