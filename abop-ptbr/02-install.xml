		If you are using a Linux distribution such as Fedora or Mandrake or
		{put your choice here}, or a BSD system such as FreeBSD, then you probably already
		have Python installed on your system.
		
		</para>
		<para>
		
		To test if you have Python already installed on your Linux box, open a shell
		program (like <application>konsole</application> or
		<application>gnome-terminal</application>) and enter the command
		<command>python -V</command> as shown below.
		
		</para>
		<informalexample>
			<screen>
$ python -V
Python 2.3.4
			</screen>
		</informalexample>
		
		<note>
			<para>
			
			<prompt>$</prompt> is the prompt of the shell. It will be different for you
			depending on the settings of your OS, hence I will indicate the prompt by
			just the <prompt>$</prompt> symbol.
			
			</para>
		</note>
		
		<para>
		
		If you see some version information like the one shown above, then you have
		Python installed already.
		
		</para>
		<para>
		
		However, if you get a message like this one:
		
		</para>
		<screen>
$ python -V
bash: python: command not found
		</screen>
		<para>
		
		then, you don't have Python installed. This is highly unlikely but possible.
		
		</para>
		<para>
		
		In this case, you have two ways of installing Python on your system.
		
		</para>

				Install the binary packages using the package management software
				that comes with your OS, such as <application>yum</application> in
				Fedora Linux, <application>urpmi</application> in Mandrake Linux,
				<application>apt-get</application> in Debian Linux,
				<application>pkg_add</application> in FreeBSD, etc. Note that you
				will need an internet connection to use this method.
				
				</para>
				<para>
				
				Alternatively, you can download the binaries from somewhere else and
				then copy to your PC and install it.

				You can compile Python from the <ulink url="http://www.python.org/download/"

		<title>For Windows Users</title>
		
		<para>
		
		Visit <ulink url="http://www.python.org/download/">Python.org/download</ulink> and
		download the latest version from this website (which was
		<ulink url="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.4/Python-2.3.4.exe">2.3.4</ulink>
		as of this writing. This is just 9.4 MB which is very compact compared to most other
		languages. The installation is just like any other Windows-based software.
		
		</para>
		
		<caution>
			<para>
			
			When you are given the option of unchecking any <emphasis>optional</emphasis>
			components, don't uncheck any! Some of these components can be useful for you,
			especially IDLE.
			
			</para>
		</caution>
		
		<para>
		
		An interesting fact is that about 70% of Python downloads are by Windows users. Of course,
		this doesn't give the complete picture since almost all Linux users will have Python
		installed already on their systems by default.
		
		</para>

			<title>Using Python in the Windows command line</title>
			<para>
			
			If you want to be able to use Python from the Windows command line, then you
			need to set the PATH variable appropriately.
			
			</para>
			<para>
			
			For Windows 2000, XP, 2003 , click on <guimenu>Control Panel</guimenu> ->
			<guisubmenu>System</guisubmenu> -> <guisubmenu>Advanced</guisubmenu> ->
			<guimenuitem>Environment Variables</guimenuitem>. Click on the variable
			named <emphasis role="bold">PATH</emphasis> in the 'System Variables'
			section, then select <guimenuitem>Edit</guimenuitem> and add
			<command>;C:\Python23</command> (without the quotes) to the end of
			what is already there. Of course, use the appropriate directory name.
			
			</para>
			<para>
			
			For older versions of Windows, add the following line to the file
			<filename>C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT</filename> : '<command>PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python23</command>'
			(without the quotes) and restart the system. For Windows NT, use the 
			<filename>AUTOEXEC.NT</filename> file.

		<title>Summary</title>
		<para>
		
		For a Linux system, you most probably already have Python installed on your system.
		Otherwise, you can install it using the package management software that comes with
		your distribution. For a Windows system, installing Python is as easy as downloading
		the installer and double-clicking on it. From now on, we will assume that you have
		Python installed on your system.
		
		</para>
		<para>
		
		Next, we will write our first Python program.
